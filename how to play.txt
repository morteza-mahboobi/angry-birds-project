To play, you have two ways to move :
1- One way is to hold or press "ENTER" key
2- Another way is automatically

Also, to give value you have two ways :
1- Enter (speed) & (angle) 
2- Enter (speed along the x-axis) & (speed along the y-axis) & (acceleration)

To change both of the above, you must go to the settings
